The solution often involves a multi-step process:

1. **Clean Node Modules:** Delete your `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`  or `rm -rf node_modules && yarn install`.
2. **Audit Dependencies:**  Use `npm ls` or `npm-check-updates` to identify outdated or conflicting packages. Update as needed using `npm update` or `npm update <package-name>`.
3. **Check Expo Compatibility:** Ensure that your project's dependencies are compatible with your current Expo CLI version. Consult the Expo documentation for compatibility guidelines.
4. **Verify Native Libraries:** If the error involves native libraries, double-check that you've followed all the necessary installation and linking instructions for those libraries.  Consider rebuilding the native modules.
5. **Expo Upgrade/Downgrade:**  In some cases, upgrading or downgrading your Expo CLI version might resolve the conflict. However, carefully consider compatibility issues before making such changes.
6. **Clean the project cache:** try `expo prebuild --clean` before rebuilding.

// Example of a resolved dependency conflict (replace with your actual code):
// BEFORE:
// "react-native-vector-icons": "^6.4.0"
// AFTER:
// "react-native-vector-icons": "^7.1.0"

Remember to carefully review the specific error messages to understand the root cause and tailor your approach accordingly.
