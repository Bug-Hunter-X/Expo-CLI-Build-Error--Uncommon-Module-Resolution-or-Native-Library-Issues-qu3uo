# Expo CLI Build Error: Uncommon Module Resolution or Native Library Issues

This repository demonstrates a troubleshooting example for uncommon build errors in Expo CLI.  These errors often arise from dependency conflicts or incompatibilities between Expo's version and your project's setup.

**Problem:**

The `expo build` process fails, often with cryptic error messages related to module resolution or missing native libraries.  These errors are not consistently reproducible and can depend on the project's specific dependencies and Expo version.

**Solution:**

This repository provides a potential solution involving dependency audits, careful version checking, and potentially cleaning up the node modules.

**Steps to Reproduce (May Vary):**

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Attempt to build the project: `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`
4. Observe the error messages.
5.  Follow the solution steps in `expoBugSolution.js`

**Additional Notes:**

*   This is a general template, and the exact error and solution will vary based on individual project setup.
*   Check the Expo documentation and community forums for specific guidance on resolving module-related build errors.
